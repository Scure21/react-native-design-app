### DESCRIPTION

This project was done following the designcode.io React Native course for designers as a means of testing out a few transitions/animations and practice some RN specific elements such as navigation, layout adjustment for different screen sizes and getting data through a CMS.

With this code you won't be able to consume the data from Contentful because you'd need to create an account and add your SPACE_ID and APOLLO_CLIENT_TOKEN. If you don't want to go that route, the `data` folder has some static data you can use for the cards and courses, you'd need to adjust things accordingly. 

Here is a picture of what the app looks like in different devices:
